Every Sunday my wife asks me what she should make for dinner that week. I'm not the quickest thinker when it comes to food ideas, especially vegetarian ones (she's vegetarian), so I decided to build this simple app to make my life easier. It is still a work in progress... but it works.

Bon appetit!
