# vegetarian-recipe-machine a.k.a. "recipe slots"

An app that simultaneously produces three random vegetarian recipes at the push of a button.

Tech stack: Node JS, Angular, Express

Every Sunday my wife asks me what she should make for dinner that week. I'm not the quickest thinker when it comes to food ideas, especially vegetarian ones (my wife is vegetarian), so I decided to build this app to make my life easier.

A push of a button triggers an API call to the Spoonacular database of over 300,000 recipes. If any of them look interesting, click on the image and the ingredients and instructions appear below. Nothing tickling your fancy? Click the button for three more random recipes. Repeat.

Bon appetit!
